# Hi!

Before you dive in, please read these instructions:
Start with Gamified Psyche, PhotonSaver, then, end it with the most robust project: Endless Expanse!

* Gamified Psyche (Tested on Windows, but possibly compatible on Linux if Love2D is installed.)
Download Love2D from here (if not already installed): https://www.love2d.org/
Afterwards, edit the batch file to be compatible with your love.exe location!
The source code should be visible in the folder called Gamified_Psyche. Feel free to review it.

* PhotonSaver (Windows Only)
Download Roblox Studio (if not already installed). Then, open it up & login/create an account. 
Afterwards, load an empty baseplate. Click the Plugins dropdown on the top of your screen's navbar, and hit Plugins Folder.
Drag & drop the PhotonSaver.rbxmx into the newly opened folder.

* Also, if you want to review the code, drag the rbxmx into the screen & it should appear within Workspace. Feel free to drag it anywhere else.
To modify the code & update the plugin, right click on the folder that appeared from dragging the rbxmx, and hover over Save / Export, and hit  "Save as Local Plugin"

* Endless Expanse (Windows Only)
If you downloaded Roblox Studio previously & logged in, all you need to do is launch the game and press play.
I would personally recommend investigating the code first, however - as some of the gameplay is not complete, and the
value of the project is in its underlying systems.
Also, the ranges from 2 to 0 years old, so it may have varying casing styles as my programming evolved overtime from 10th grade.
	Aspects of the project that I can confidently say are complete significantly enough:
		* Flowing Systems Manager
		* Celestial Bodies Spawner & Star Manager
		* Everything in CoreSystems. The new EntityComponentSystem is a work in progress in terms of implementation, but the groundwork works well.
		* The stuff in Game_Functionality works, even if it's not refactored.
		* Review Saving_Modules, it contains
		* Terrain Generation's code needs to be refactored, but is complete. You can find it in Terrain_Modules.Terrain_Generator3.2415926535897932384626
		
Happy reviewing,
Petra
