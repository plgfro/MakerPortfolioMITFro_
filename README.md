# Hi!

Before you dive in, please read these instructions:
Start with Gamified Psyche, PhotonSaver, then, end it with the most robust project: Endless Expanse!

* Gamified Psyche (Tested on Windows, but possibly compatible on Linux if Love2D is installed.)
Download Love2D from here (if not already installed): https://www.love2d.org/
Afterwards, edit the batch file to be compatible with your love.exe location!

* PhotonSaver (Windows Only)
Download Roblox Studio (if not already installed). Then, open it up & login/create an account. 
Afterwards, load an empty baseplate. Click the Plugins dropdown on the top of your screen's navbar, and hit Plugins Folder.
Drag & drop the PhotonSaver.rbxmx into the newly opened folder.

* Endless Expanse (Windows Only)
If you downloaded Roblox Studio previously & logged in, all you need to do is launch the game and press play.
I would personally recommend investigating the code first, however - as some of the gameplay is not complete, and the
value of the project is in its underlying systems.
Also, the ranges from 2 to 0 years old, so it may have varying casing styles as my programming evolved overtime from 10th grade.

Happy reviewing,
Petra
